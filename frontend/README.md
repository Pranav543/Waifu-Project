## Architecture of the Dapp

This Dapp consists of multiple React Components, which you can find in
`src/components`.

Most of them are presentational components, have no logic, and just render HTML.

The core functionality is implemented in `src/components/Dapp.js`, which has
examples of how to connect to the user's wallet, initialize your Ethereum
connection and contracts, read from the contract's state, and send transactions.

You can use the `Dapp` component as a starting point for your project. It has
comments explaining each part of its code, and indicating what's specific to
this project, and what can be reused.
